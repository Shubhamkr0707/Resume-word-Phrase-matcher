Hello,
In this, we simply scan all resume 
we received by making our requirement.csv 
and In this file, we add all Skills or words 
we want to find in the resume.
With the help of "spaCy's PhraseMatcher," 
it matches all words and gives us output in form of a CSV file 
with a name and matched word.
We can visualize the data of the resume.
Example:-
Suppose Hr receives too many resumes for particular job requirements, 
so how can they shortlist the best candidate among them, 
if they read one by one it consumes a lot of time. 
So here comes our idea simply they will make requirement.csv 
and upload the file and find the best candidate by scanning all them 
and get proper visualized data and also get an Output.csv with 
name and skills that match.
